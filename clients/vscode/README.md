# Confit LSP

LSP client for the [Confit] configuration system ([`confit-lite`] at the moment).

![Example diagnostics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bdura/confit-lite/refs/heads/main/clients/vscode/assets/diagnostics.png)

## Getting started

This extension does not ship with the [LSP][`confit-lite`] itself,
you need to install it separately:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/bdura/confit-lite[lsp]
```

See the [`confit-lite`] docs for more information.
